# LocalStorageExercise
In this exercise:

- The boxes from the events exercise become notes, and the only difference in terms of features is the user should be able to update a note.
- The notes, color, and ID counter should be saved to local storage and read from the local storage when the page opens.
- If a note gets deleted, it should also be removed from the local storage.
- If a note gets updated, it should also be reflected in the local storage.
